- **Evidence-Based Findings**: Detailed explanations with remediation steps

### 📊 Implemented Security Rules

#### Terraform (10+ rules)
```typescript
// AWS
TF_AWS_S3_PUBLIC          // Public S3 buckets
TF_AWS_S3_NO_ENCRYPTION   // Missing S3 encryption
TF_AWS_SG_OPEN_ALL        // Overly permissive security groups
TF_AWS_SG_SSH_OPEN        // SSH from 0.0.0.0/0

// Kubernetes
K8S_NO_LIMITS             // Missing resource limits
K8S_PRIV_ESC              // Privilege escalation allowed
K8S_RUN_AS_ROOT           // Running as root user
K8S_LATEST_TAG            // Using :latest tags
```

### 🔧 MCP Tools Implemented

1. **explainPlan**: Terraform plan analysis with risk assessment
2. **validateK8s**: Kubernetes manifest security validation
3. **hardening**: Security fix generation (framework ready)
4. **costDelta**: Cost analysis and comparison (framework ready)
